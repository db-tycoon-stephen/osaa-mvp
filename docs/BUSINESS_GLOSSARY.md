## Overview

This business glossary provides definitions and explanations for terms used throughout the OSAA Data Pipeline. It serves as a reference for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to ensure consistent understanding of concepts, metrics, and terminology.

## Key Concepts

### 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
The global framework adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, providing a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. It includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets to be achieved by 2030.

### Development Indicator
A quantitative or qualitative measure that provides information about development progress, conditions, or trends. Examples include GDP per capita, literacy rates, or life expectancy.

### Data Pipeline
An automated system that ingests, transforms, and delivers data from various sources to end users. The OSAA pipeline processes development indicators from multiple international organizations.

### Master Data
The single, authoritative source of truth for critical business data. In the OSAA pipeline, the master.indicators table serves as master data for all development metrics.

### Data Lake
A centralized repository (S3 in this case) that stores structured and unstructured data at scale. The OSAA data lake contains raw, processed, and analytical datasets.

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
The process of extracting data from source systems, transforming it into a useful format, and loading it into a destination system. The OSAA pipeline performs ETL on development indicators.

## Indicator Types

### Tier I Indicators
SDG indicators that are conceptually clear, have internationally established methodology, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50% of countries.

### Tier II Indicators
SDG indicators that are conceptually clear and have internationally established methodology but data are not regularly produced by countries.

### Tier III Indicators
SDG indicators for which no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology/standards are being developed.

### Composite Indicators
Indicators that combine multiple individual indicators into a single measure. Examples include the Human Development Index (HDI) or the Gender Inequality Index (GII).

### Leading Indicators
Metrics that predict future trends or outcomes. For example, education enrollment rates may indicate future economic development.

### Lagging Indicators
Metrics that confirm trends after they have occurred. GDP growth rates are typically lagging indicators of economic performance.

## Measurement Terms

### Baseline
The initial measurement against which progress is assessed. For SDGs, 2015 is often used as the baseline year.

### Target
A specific, measurable goal to be achieved by a certain date. SDG targets specify desired outcomes by 2030.

### Benchmark
A standard or reference point against which performance is measured. Can be based on best practices or peer comparisons.

### Threshold
A critical value that triggers action or indicates a significant change in status. For example, poverty threshold of $1.90 per day.

### Coverage
The extent to which data is available for a given indicator. Expressed as percentage of countries or population covered.

### Granularity
The level of detail in the data. Can refer to geographic (national vs. subnational) or temporal (annual vs. monthly) detail.

### Magnitude

- **Units**: Individual count (people, schools, etc.)
- **Thousands**: Values multiplied by 1,000
- **Millions**: Values multiplied by 1,000,000

## Calculation Methodologies

### Aggregation Methods

#### Simple Average
The arithmetic mean of values. Used when all observations have equal weight.
```
Average = Sum of all values / Number of values
```

#### Weighted Average
Mean where observations have different importance weights. Often weighted by population.
```
Weighted Average = Sum(Value Ã— Weight) / Sum(Weights)
```

#### Median
The middle value when data is ordered. Less sensitive to outliers than mean.

#### Geometric Mean
Used for rates and ratios. Appropriate for data that grows exponentially.
```
Geometric Mean = (Product of n values)^(1/n)
```

### Growth Calculations

#### Year-over-Year Growth
Percentage change from same period in previous year.
```
YoY Growth = ((Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year) Ã— 100
```

#### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
Average annual growth rate over a period.
```
CAGR = ((Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Number of Years) - 1) Ã— 100
```

### Normalization Techniques

#### Min-Max Normalization
Scales values to 0-1 range.
```
Normalized = (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)
```

#### Z-Score Normalization
Standardizes based on mean and standard deviation.
```
Z-Score = (Value - Mean) / Standard Deviation
```
